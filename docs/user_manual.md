- Take advantage of the new undo/redo functionality to experiment freely with your designs.
- Use layer controls to organize complex scenes with multiple overlapping elements.

## Common Problem Resolution

- **The diagram doesn't export correctly**: Try using a different browser, preferably Chrome or Firefox in their latest version.
- **Elements don't align correctly**: Make sure the grid is enabled to facilitate alignment.
- **The application is slow**: Reduce the number of elements in your diagram or try closing other applications to free up resources.
